# iris-ml-techniques

## Overview
This repository contains four comprehensive exercises focusing on different machine learning techniques applied to the classic Iris dataset. Each exercise explores a unique aspect of machine learning, from Support Vector Machines to dimensionality reduction with Linear Discriminant Analysis.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in pattern recognition literature, containing measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species:

Iris Setosa
Iris Versicolor
Iris Virginica

Dataset Features:

Samples: 150 (50 from each species)

Features: 4 (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)

Target: 3 classes (the three species)

## Implemented Techniques
Support Vector Machine (SVM):
- Visualization of decision boundaries

K-Fold Cross Validation:
- Stratified cross-validation
- Metrics evaluation

Hyperparameter Optimization:
- Grid Search implementation for exhaustive parameter exploration
- Random Search for efficient parameter selection

4. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):
- Visualization of class separation in lower-dimensional space
- Comparison with PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Classification performance analysis

## Requisites
python >= 3.6
scikit-learn 
numpy 
matplotlib 
seaborn 
pandas 
jupyter
